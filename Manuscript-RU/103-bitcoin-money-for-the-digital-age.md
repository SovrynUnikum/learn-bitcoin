## Bitcoin - Money for the Digital Age

If people ask what Bitcoin is, my first and shortest answer is: Bitcoin is digital cash. It's like the banknotes and coins in your pocket. It belongs to you, nobody can hinder you from spending it. If you use cash to buy a bicycle, you hand the seller your banknotes and coins. You do not need to trust the seller, because you got your bicycle and the shop got its money. The deal is closed without a bank, identification or credit card.

The same is true for bitcoin. When you buy something, whether on the Internet or in a store and pay with bitcoin, the value you are sending moves directly from you to the other person. Without a bank, without PayPal and without credit cards, the transaction remains secure, trustless and unforgeable - this is revolutionary.

The Bitcoin network is open source software and belongs to no one. It's a common good. There is no company behind Bitcoin. Anyone can download, run and view the code, and make suggestions for improvement without asking for permission. Any decision as to whether and how to make changes to the rules must be made by the consensus of all parties involved. There is no hierarchy. Bitcoin creates trust through merging techniques from different fields of science: cryptography, a globally distributed computer network, an unchangeable database of all transactions (blockchain) and a game-theoretical incentive system for securing the network and issuing the money (mining).

In contrast to fiat money like the Euro or USD, which are controlled by their respective central banks, this is a completely new system. Trust is not dependent on a hierarchical, political system but is built on mathematics, cryptography, and a self-regulating consensus system. 

Bitcoin is built on a set of rules. It is a self-regulating system, based on mathematics and cryptography that is enforcing the issuance of newly minted coins on the basis of a protocol without arbitrary human interventions. Censorship of transactions or negative interest rates are not possible, therefore it is a reliable way of securing value and assets.
