(L)earn Bitcoin is the best guide to decide why and how you should enter the world of Bitcoin. It presents Bitcoin in all its facets, from its technical, economical, political and social implications to how it is evolving in the current monetary landscape. It provides a step-by-step roadmap to navigate this new financial world and sets you up with concrete recommendations on how to safely acquire, earn and store bitcoin. Ascending the staircase of financial sovereignty will grant you personal freedom and control over your money. 

In this book, you will find answers to the questions of what money is, where it comes from, its historical development, blockchain technology and Bitcoin specifically. It gives answers to the questions why and how to use Bitcoin, while debunking popular myths and misunderstandings surrounding cryptocurrencies. I take a deep dive into Bitcoin's development since its inception in 2008 and give an outlook on future applications of money based on Bitcoin. 

While mainstream media and economic pundits in the Western world think that it's just a tool for speculation, my goal is to spread the word about Bitcoin as an enabler of financial fairness and social change. What goes unmentioned are the positive real-world implications that a truly permissionless, uncensorable, neutral digital asset with a fixed supply offers.

Later in the book, I will focus on the more practical applications of bitcoin (BTC) and how you can safely acquire and store it. You will learn how to gain confidence by starting with small amounts, how to minimize the existing risks and proceed strategically and efficiently in storing your wealth for the long-term.

This is neither financial advice nor a trading guide to the thousands of Altcoins in existence. If you are only interested in short-term gains, treating money like you're gambling in a casino, this book is not for you. It's for people who want to (l)earn and understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin and control their funds in a self-sovereign manner.
